SpaceX Starship and Mars Colonization Overview

1. Starship Launch Vehicle
Starship is a fully reusable, super heavy-lift launch vehicle under development by SpaceX. It is the tallest and most powerful rocket ever built.
- Height: 121 meters (397 ft) stacked.
- Stages: Two stages.
  - First Stage: Super Heavy booster (33 Raptor engines).
  - Second Stage: Starship spacecraft (6 Raptor engines).
- Payload Capacity: 100–150 tonnes to Low Earth Orbit (LEO) in fully reusable configuration.
- Fuel: Liquid methane (CH4) and liquid oxygen (LOX), known as Methalox.

2. Mars Colonization Plans
Elon Musk's goal involves sending the first uncrewed Starship to Mars within a few launch windows (launch windows occur every 26 months).
- Objective: Establish a self-sustaining city on Mars.
- Fleet: Musk envisions building 1,000 Starships to transport 1 million people to Mars by 2050.
- In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU): The plan relies on manufacturing fuel on Mars using water ice and atmospheric CO2 (Sabatier reaction).

3. Key Milestones
- IFT-4 (Flight 4): Successfully demonstrated soft splashodwn of both Super Heavy and Starship in the ocean in June 2024.
- Launch Site: Starbase, Boca Chica, Texas.
- Artemis Program: NASA selected a variant of Starship (HLS) to land astronauts on the Moon for the Artemis III mission.

4. Raptor Engines
- The Raptor is a full-flow staged combustion cycle engine.
- It is designed to be highly efficient and reusable.
- Thrust: Raptor 2 produces roughly 230 tonnes of force.

5. Recent Developments (2024-2025 Context)
- Focus is on achieving full reuse: catching the Super Heavy booster with the "Mechazilla" tower arms (nicknamed "Chopsticks").
- Orbital refuelling tests are crucial for deep space missions.
